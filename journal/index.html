            <h2>Overlay Lightbox</h2>

        <p>When I first learned and mastered techniques about creating overlay in css and html, I found it so fancy and planned to include it in my project. The article from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/" class="source">Nielson Norman Group</a> drew my attention to consider the necessity for creating an overlay lightbox. Although it is a fancy skill, it might interrupt users by misusing lightbox such as prompting an anchor overlay box. There is a instructful way to think whether the content should be on a lightbox by carefully examining the 5Ws: Who is the target audience, When the overlay box prompt, What content or decisions will be displayed, Where the box will display and Why it has to be a lightbox. </p>

            <h2>Best Practice for Forms</h2>

        <p>Effective design is much more than considering aesthetics. From the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" class="source">Best practice for form design</a>, I learned there are so many considerations and adjustments regarding form design to improve usability and user conversion which is the ultimate goal for website and mobile applications. Additionally, form can help companies build connections and collect desired information directly from users. </p>
        <p>The first principle, “less is more”, stands out for me. As UI/UX designers, we have to consider visual workload for users. In the Madlib project, I had too many inputs which might annoy my users, so I plan to delete unnecessary information and divide my inputs separately in several pages to minimize visual load as the article suggested. </p>
        <p>Another striking takeaway for me was the importance of single-column layouts. In past projects, I’ve occasionally experimented with multi-column forms, believing they could save space. However, I now realize that such designs may disrupt the natural reading flow, making it harder for users to process and complete forms efficiently. Moving forward, I plan to refine my approach by consistently structuring forms in a single, linear fashion to enhance clarity.</p>
        <p>There is also a surprising suggestion that the placeholder text might hurt usability.  As users type in the field the hint disappears and if users forget the hint, they need to clear the text to see it again.</p>
        <p>By applying these principles, I aim to design forms that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive, inclusive, and efficient. User-centric form design isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about removing friction and making interactions as effortless as possible.</p>
